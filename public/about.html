  I am the type of person who has various educational backgrounds.
  After completing my Senior Secondary School eduction, 
  I went to Kumasi Polytechic to study HND Mechanical Engineering where specialised in Production Engineering. 
  After my National Service at GRATIS Foundation in Wa, I had the previlage to also do Voluntary 
  Service at Kaleo Senior High Technical School where I taught Elective and Core Mathematics. 
  Whiles doing my Voluntary Service, I was lucky to get a job at Wa Polytechnic now 
  Dr Hilla Limann Technical University (Department) in Wa as an Assistant Instructor at the Department of 
  Mechanical Engineering.
</p>

<p>
  During my days at the Polytechnic, I had the passion of studying Information Technology.
  After working for sometime, I decided to go to the University to pursue my dream in IT
  by enrolling for a BSc in Computer Engineering Program since I was coming from an
  Enginnering and was also employed in the Faculty of Engineering at DHLTU.
</p>
<p>
  Due to my job schedule at the Mechanical Engineering Department, I have not been able to practice 
  as a Computer Engineer.
</p>

<p>
  In order to go back to my dream of becoming an IT professional, I have decided to enrol in the 
  Udemy platform where I can learn full stack development in web design through various tutorials 
  on that platform.
</p>

<p>
  <h4>I am currently hoping make a carrier change after completing the Udemy course on Web development</h4>

  <h4>
    I am willing to improve myself and I know I can only achieve this through hands-on projects
    I am therefor looking for an intenship opportunity remotely in order for me improve my skills
